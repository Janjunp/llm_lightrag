It is natural to consider an extension to a bi-directional optical ﬂow, which can be\nobtained by computing an additional set of displacement ﬁelds in the opposite direction. We then\nconstruct an input volume I\u001cby stackingL=2forward ﬂows between frames \u001cand\u001c+L=2andL=2\nbackward ﬂows between frames \u001c\u0000L=2and\u001c. The inputI\u001cthus has the same number of channels\n(2L) as before. The ﬂows can be represented using either of the two methods (1) and (2).\nMean ﬂow subtraction. It is generally beneﬁcial to perform zero-centering of the network input,\nas it allows the model to better exploit the rectiﬁcation non-linearities. In our case, the displacement\nvector ﬁeld components can take on both positive and negative values, and are naturally centered in\nthe sense that across a large variety of motions, the movement in one direction is as probable as the\nmovement in the opposite one. However, given a pair of frames, the optical ﬂow between them can\nbe dominated by a particular displacement, e.g. caused by the camera movement. The importance\nof camera motion compensation has been previously highlighted in [10, 26], where a global motion\ncomponent was estimated and subtracted from the dense ﬂow. In our case, we consider a simpler\napproach: from each displacement ﬁeld dwe subtract its mean vector.\nArchitecture. Above we have described different ways of combining multiple optical ﬂow displace-\nment ﬁelds into a single volume I\u001c2Rw\u0002h\u00022L. Considering that a ConvNet requires a ﬁxed-size\ninput, we sample a 224\u0002224\u00022Lsub-volume from I\u001cand pass it to the net as input. The hid-\nden layers conﬁguration remains largely the same as that used in the spatial net, and is illustrated\nin Fig. 1. Testing is similar to the spatial ConvNet, and is described in detail in Sect. 5.\n3.2 Relation of the temporal ConvNet architecture to previous representations\nIn this section, we put our temporal ConvNet architecture in the context of prior art, drawing con-\nnections to the video representations, reviewed in Sect. 1.1. Methods based on feature encod-\nings [17, 29] typically combine several spatio-temporal local features. Such features are computed\nfrom the optical ﬂow and are thus generalised by our temporal ConvNet. Indeed, the HOF and MBH\n4local descriptors are based on the histograms of orientations of optical ﬂow or its gradient, which\ncan be obtained from the displacement ﬁeld input (1) using a single convolutional layer (containing\norientation-sensitive ﬁlters), followed by the rectiﬁcation and pooling layers. The kinematic features\nof [10] (divergence, curl and shear) are also computed from the optical ﬂow gradient, and, again, can\nbe captured by our convolutional model. Finally, the trajectory feature [29] is computed by stack-\ning the displacement vectors along the trajectory, which corresponds to the trajectory stacking (2).\nIn Sect. 3.3 we visualise the convolutional ﬁlters, learnt in the ﬁrst layer of the temporal network.\nThis provides further evidence that our representation generalises hand-crafted features.\nAs far as the deep networks are concerned, a two-stream video classiﬁcation architecture of [16]\ncontains two HMAX models which are hand-crafted and less deep than our discriminatively trained\nConvNets, which can be seen as a learnable generalisation of HMAX. The convolutional models\nof [12, 14] do not decouple spatial and temporal recognition streams, and rely on the motion-\nsensitive convolutional ﬁlters, learnt from the data. In our case, motion is explicitly represented\nusing the optical ﬂow displacement ﬁeld, computed based on the assumptions of constancy of the\nintensity and smoothness of the ﬂow. Incorporating such assumptions into a ConvNet framework\nmight be able to boost the performance of end-to-end ConvNet-based methods, and is an interesting\ndirection for future research.\n3.3 Visualisation of learnt convolutional ﬁlters\n96 1 2 \nflow 1  \nflow 10  \nflow 1  \nflow 10  conv. filters on  \nvertical flow  \ncomponents  𝑑𝑦 \n conv. fliters  on \nhorizontal flow  \ncomponents  𝑑𝑥 \n \ntemporal  \nderivative  \nspatial  \nderivative  \nFigure 4: First-layer convolutional ﬁlters learnt on 10 stacked optical ﬂows.

When pre-training the spatial ConvNet, we use the\nsame training and test data augmentation as described above (cropping, ﬂipping, RGB jittering).\nThis yields 13:5%top-5 error on ILSVRC-2012 validation set, which compares favourably to 16:0%\nreported in [31] for a similar network. We believe that the main reason for the improvement is\nsampling of ConvNet inputs from the whole image, rather than just its center.\nMulti-GPU training. Our implementation is derived from the publicly available Caffe toolbox [13],\nbut contains a number of signiﬁcant modiﬁcations, including parallel training on multiple GPUs\ninstalled in a single system. We exploit the data parallelism, and split each SGD batch across several\nGPUs. Training a single temporal ConvNet takes 1 day on a system with 4 NVIDIA Titan cards,\nwhich constitutes a 3:2times speed-up over single-GPU training.\nOptical ﬂow is computed using the off-the-shelf GPU implementation of [2] from the OpenCV\ntoolbox. In spite of the fast computation time ( 0:06s for a pair of frames), it would still introduce\na bottleneck if done on-the-ﬂy, so we pre-computed the ﬂow before training. To avoid storing\nthe displacement ﬁelds as ﬂoats, the horizontal and vertical components of the ﬂow were linearly\nrescaled to a [0;255] range and compressed using JPEG (after decompression, the ﬂow is rescaled\nback to its original range). This reduced the ﬂow size for the UCF-101 dataset from 1.5TB to 27GB.\n6 Evaluation\nDatasets and evaluation protocol. The evaluation is performed on UCF-101 [24] and\nHMDB-51 [16] action recognition benchmarks, which are among the largest available annotated\nvideo datasets1. UCF-101 contains 13K videos (180 frames/video on average), annotated into 101\naction classes; HMDB-51 includes 6.8K videos of 51 actions. The evaluation protocol is the same\n1Very recently, [14] released the Sports-1M dataset of 1.1M automatically annotated YouTube sports videos.\nProcessing the dataset of such scale is very challenging, and we plan to address it in future work.\n6for both datasets: the organisers provide three splits into training and test data, and the performance\nis measured by the mean classiﬁcation accuracy across the splits. Each UCF-101 split contains 9.5K\ntraining videos; an HMDB-51 split contains 3.7K training videos. We begin by comparing different\narchitectures on the ﬁrst split of the UCF-101 dataset. For comparison with the state of the art, we\nfollow the standard evaluation protocol and report the average accuracy over three splits on both\nUCF-101 and HMDB-51.\nSpatial ConvNets. First, we measure the performance of the spatial stream ConvNet. Three sce-\nnarios are considered: (i) training from scratch on UCF-101, (ii) pre-training on ILSVRC-2012\nfollowed by ﬁne-tuning on UCF-101, (iii) keeping the pre-trained network ﬁxed and only training\nthe last (classiﬁcation) layer. For each of the settings, we experiment with setting the dropout regu-\nlarisation ratio to 0:5or to 0:9. From the results, presented in Table 1a, it is clear that training the\nConvNet solely on the UCF-101 dataset leads to over-ﬁtting (even with high dropout), and is inferior\nto pre-training on a large ILSVRC-2012 dataset. Interestingly, ﬁne-tuning the whole network gives\nonly marginal improvement over training the last layer only. In the latter setting, higher dropout\nover-regularises learning and leads to worse accuracy. In the following experiments we opted for\ntraining the last layer on top of a pre-trained ConvNet.\nTable 1: Individual ConvNets accuracy on UCF-101 (split 1).\n(a)Spatial ConvNet.\nTraining settingDropout ratio\n0:5 0:9\nFrom scratch 42.5% 52.3%\nPre-trained + ﬁne-tuning 70.8% 72.8%\nPre-trained + last layer 72.7% 59.9%(b)Temporal ConvNet.\nInput conﬁgurationMean subtraction\noff on\nSingle-frame optical ﬂow ( L= 1) - 73.9%\nOptical ﬂow stacking (1) ( L= 5) - 80.4%\nOptical ﬂow stacking (1) ( L= 10 ) 79.9% 81.0%\nTrajectory stacking (2)( L= 10 ) 79.6% 80.2%\nOptical ﬂow stacking (1)( L= 10 ), bi-dir. - 81.2%\nTemporal ConvNets.

In\nparticular, we measure the effect of: using multiple ( L=f5;10g) stacked optical ﬂows; trajectory\nstacking; mean displacement subtraction; using the bi-directional optical ﬂow.

It is natural to consider an extension to a bi-directional optical \\ufb02ow, which can be\\nobtained by computing an additional set of displacement \\ufb01elds in the opposite direction. We then\\nconstruct an input volume I\\u001cby stackingL=2forward \\ufb02ows between frames \\u001cand\\u001c+L=2andL=2\\nbackward \\ufb02ows between frames \\u001c\\u0000L=2and\\u001c. The inputI\\u001cthus has the same number of channels\\n(2L) as before. The \\ufb02ows can be represented using either of the two methods (1) and (2).\\nMean \\ufb02ow subtraction. It is generally bene\\ufb01cial to perform zero-centering of the network input,\\nas it allows the model to better exploit the recti\\ufb01cation non-linearities. In our case, the displacement\\nvector \\ufb01eld components can take on both positive and negative values, and are naturally centered in\\nthe sense that across a large variety of motions, the movement in one direction is as probable as the\\nmovement in the opposite one. However, given a pair of frames, the optical \\ufb02ow between them can\\nbe dominated by a particular displacement, e.g. caused by the camera movement. The importance\\nof camera motion compensation has been previously highlighted in [10, 26], where a global motion\\ncomponent was estimated and subtracted from the dense \\ufb02ow. In our case, we consider a simpler\\napproach: from each displacement \\ufb01eld dwe subtract its mean vector.\\nArchitecture. Above we have described different ways of combining multiple optical \\ufb02ow displace-\\nment \\ufb01elds into a single volume I\\u001c2Rw\\u0002h\\u00022L. Considering that a ConvNet requires a \\ufb01xed-size\\ninput, we sample a 224\\u0002224\\u00022Lsub-volume from I\\u001cand pass it to the net as input. The hid-\\nden layers con\\ufb01guration remains largely the same as that used in the spatial net, and is illustrated\\nin Fig. 1. Testing is similar to the spatial ConvNet, and is described in detail in Sect. 5.\\n3.2 Relation of the temporal ConvNet architecture to previous representations\\nIn this section, we put our temporal ConvNet architecture in the context of prior art, drawing con-\\nnections to the video representations, reviewed in Sect. 1.1. Methods based on feature encod-\\nings [17, 29] typically combine several spatio-temporal local features. Such features are computed\\nfrom the optical \\ufb02ow and are thus generalised by our temporal ConvNet. Indeed, the HOF and MBH\\n4local descriptors are based on the histograms of orientations of optical \\ufb02ow or its gradient, which\\ncan be obtained from the displacement \\ufb01eld input (1) using a single convolutional layer (containing\\norientation-sensitive \\ufb01lters), followed by the recti\\ufb01cation and pooling layers. The kinematic features\\nof [10] (divergence, curl and shear) are also computed from the optical \\ufb02ow gradient, and, again, can\\nbe captured by our convolutional model. Finally, the trajectory feature [29] is computed by stack-\\ning the displacement vectors along the trajectory, which corresponds to the trajectory stacking (2).\\nIn Sect. 3.3 we visualise the convolutional \\ufb01lters, learnt in the \\ufb01rst layer of the temporal network.\\nThis provides further evidence that our representation generalises hand-crafted features.\\nAs far as the deep networks are concerned, a two-stream video classi\\ufb01cation architecture of [16]\\ncontains two HMAX models which are hand-crafted and less deep than our discriminatively trained\\nConvNets, which can be seen as a learnable generalisation of HMAX. The convolutional models\\nof [12, 14] do not decouple spatial and temporal recognition streams, and rely on the motion-\\nsensitive convolutional \\ufb01lters, learnt from the data. In our case, motion is explicitly represented\\nusing the optical \\ufb02ow displacement \\ufb01eld, computed based on the assumptions of constancy of the\\nintensity and smoothness of the \\ufb02ow. Incorporating such assumptions into a ConvNet framework\\nmight be able to boost the performance of end-to-end ConvNet-based methods, and is an interesting\\ndirection for future research.\\n3.3 Visualisation of learnt convolutional \\ufb01lters\\n96 1 2 \\nflow 1  \\nflow 10  \\nflow 1  \\nflow 10  conv. filters on  \\nvertical flow  \\ncomponents  \\ud835\\udc51\\ud835\\udc66 \\n conv. fliters  on \\nhorizontal flow  \\ncomponents  \\ud835\\udc51\\ud835\\udc65 \\n \\ntemporal  \\nderivative  \\nspatial  \\nderivative  \\nFigure 4: First-layer convolutional \\ufb01lters learnt on 10 stacked optical \\ufb02ows.

In\nparticular, we measure the effect of: using multiple ( L=f5;10g) stacked optical ﬂows; trajectory\nstacking; mean displacement subtraction; using the bi-directional optical ﬂow. The architectures\nare trained on the UCF-101 dataset from scratch, so we used an aggressive dropout ratio of 0:9to\nhelp improve generalisation. The results are shown in Table 1b. First, we can conclude that stacking\nmultiple (L>1) displacement ﬁelds in the input is highly beneﬁcial, as it provides the network with\nlong-term motion information, which is more discriminative than the ﬂow between a pair of frames\n(L= 1setting). Increasing the number of input ﬂows from 5to10leads to a smaller improvement,\nso we keptLﬁxed to 10in the following experiments. Second, we ﬁnd that mean subtraction is\nhelpful, as it reduces the effect of global motion between the frames. We use it in the following\nexperiments as default. The difference between different stacking techniques is marginal; it turns\nout that optical ﬂow stacking performs better than trajectory stacking, and using the bi-directional\noptical ﬂow is only slightly better than a uni-directional forward ﬂow. Finally, we note that temporal\nConvNets signiﬁcantly outperform the spatial ConvNets (Table 1a), which conﬁrms the importance\nof motion information for action recognition.\nWe also implemented the “slow fusion” architecture of [14], which amounts to applying a ConvNet\nto a stack of RGB frames ( 11frames in our case). When trained from scratch on UCF-101, it\nachieved 56:4%accuracy, which is better than a single-frame architecture trained from scratch\n(52:3%), but is still far off the network trained from scratch on optical ﬂow. This shows that while\nmulti-frame information is important, it is also important to present it to a ConvNet in an appropriate\nmanner.\nMulti-task learning of temporal ConvNets. Training temporal ConvNets on UCF-101 is challeng-\ning due to the small size of the training set. An even bigger challenge is to train the ConvNet on\nHMDB-51, where each training split is 2:6times smaller than that of UCF-101. Here we evaluate\ndifferent options for increasing the effective training set size of HMDB-51: (i) ﬁne-tuning a temporal\nnetwork pre-trained on UCF-101; (ii) adding 78classes from UCF-101, which are manually selected\nso that there is no intersection between these classes and the native HMDB-51 classes; (iii) using the\nmulti-task formulation (Sect. 4) to learn a video representation, shared between the UCF-101 and\nHMDB-51 classiﬁcation tasks. The results are reported in Table 2. As expected, it is beneﬁcial to\n7Table 2: Temporal ConvNet accuracy on HMDB-51 (split 1 with additional training data).\nTraining setting Accuracy\nTraining on HMDB-51 without additional data 46.6%\nFine-tuning a ConvNet, pre-trained on UCF-101 49.0%\nTraining on HMDB-51 with classes added from UCF-101 52.8%\nMulti-task learning on HMDB-51 and UCF-101 55.4%\nutilise full (all splits combined) UCF-101 data for training (either explicitly by borrowing images, or\nimplicitly by pre-training). Multi-task learning performs the best, as it allows the training procedure\nto exploit all available training data.\nWe have also experimented with multi-task learning on the UCF-101 dataset, by training a network\nto classify both the full HMDB-51 data (all splits combined) and the UCF-101 data (a single split).\nOn the ﬁrst split of UCF-101, the accuracy was measured to be 81.5%, which improves on 81:0%\nachieved using the same settings, but without the additional HMDB classiﬁcation task (Table 1b).\nTwo-stream ConvNets. Here we evaluate the complete two-stream model, which combines the\ntwo recognition streams. One way of combining the networks would be to train a joint stack of\nfully-connected layers on top of full6 or full7 layers of the two nets. This, however, was not feasible\nin our case due to over-ﬁtting. We therefore fused the softmax scores using either averaging or\na linear SVM. From Table 3 we conclude that: (i) temporal and spatial recognition streams are\ncomplementary, as their fusion signiﬁcantly improves on both (6%over temporal and 14% over\nspatial nets); (ii) SVM-based fusion of softmax scores outperforms fusion by averaging; (iii) using\nbi-directional ﬂow is not beneﬁcial in the case of ConvNet fusion; (iv) temporal ConvNet, trained\nusing multi-task learning, performs the best both alone and when fused with a spatial net.\nTable 3: Two-stream ConvNet accuracy on UCF-101 (split 1).\nSpatial ConvNet Temporal ConvNet Fusion Method Accuracy\nPre-trained + last layer bi-directional averaging 85.6%\nPre-trained + last layer uni-directional averaging 85.9%\nPre-trained + last layer uni-directional, multi-task averaging 86.2%\nPre-trained + last layer\n######################\nOutput:\n"

When pre-training the spatial ConvNet, we use the\\nsame training and test data augmentation as described above (cropping, \\ufb02ipping, RGB jittering).\\nThis yields 13:5%top-5 error on ILSVRC-2012 validation set, which compares favourably to 16:0%\\nreported in [31] for a similar network. We believe that the main reason for the improvement is\\nsampling of ConvNet inputs from the whole image, rather than just its center.\\nMulti-GPU training. Our implementation is derived from the publicly available Caffe toolbox [13],\\nbut contains a number of signi\\ufb01cant modi\\ufb01cations, including parallel training on multiple GPUs\\ninstalled in a single system. We exploit the data parallelism, and split each SGD batch across several\\nGPUs. Training a single temporal ConvNet takes 1 day on a system with 4 NVIDIA Titan cards,\\nwhich constitutes a 3:2times speed-up over single-GPU training.\\nOptical \\ufb02ow is computed using the off-the-shelf GPU implementation of [2] from the OpenCV\\ntoolbox. In spite of the fast computation time ( 0:06s for a pair of frames), it would still introduce\\na bottleneck if done on-the-\\ufb02y, so we pre-computed the \\ufb02ow before training. To avoid storing\\nthe displacement \\ufb01elds as \\ufb02oats, the horizontal and vertical components of the \\ufb02ow were linearly\\nrescaled to a [0;255] range and compressed using JPEG (after decompression, the \\ufb02ow is rescaled\\nback to its original range). This reduced the \\ufb02ow size for the UCF-101 dataset from 1.5TB to 27GB.\\n6 Evaluation\\nDatasets and evaluation protocol. The evaluation is performed on UCF-101 [24] and\\nHMDB-51 [16] action recognition benchmarks, which are among the largest available annotated\\nvideo datasets1. UCF-101 contains 13K videos (180 frames/video on average), annotated into 101\\naction classes; HMDB-51 includes 6.8K videos of 51 actions. The evaluation protocol is the same\\n1Very recently, [14] released the Sports-1M dataset of 1.1M automatically annotated YouTube sports videos.\\nProcessing the dataset of such scale is very challenging, and we plan to address it in future work.\\n6for both datasets: the organisers provide three splits into training and test data, and the performance\\nis measured by the mean classi\\ufb01cation accuracy across the splits. Each UCF-101 split contains 9.5K\\ntraining videos; an HMDB-51 split contains 3.7K training videos. We begin by comparing different\\narchitectures on the \\ufb01rst split of the UCF-101 dataset. For comparison with the state of the art, we\\nfollow the standard evaluation protocol and report the average accuracy over three splits on both\\nUCF-101 and HMDB-51.\\nSpatial ConvNets. First, we measure the performance of the spatial stream ConvNet. Three sce-\\nnarios are considered: (i) training from scratch on UCF-101, (ii) pre-training on ILSVRC-2012\\nfollowed by \\ufb01ne-tuning on UCF-101, (iii) keeping the pre-trained network \\ufb01xed and only training\\nthe last (classi\\ufb01cation) layer. For each of the settings, we experiment with setting the dropout regu-\\nlarisation ratio to 0:5or to 0:9. From the results, presented in Table 1a, it is clear that training the\\nConvNet solely on the UCF-101 dataset leads to over-\\ufb01tting (even with high dropout), and is inferior\\nto pre-training on a large ILSVRC-2012 dataset. Interestingly, \\ufb01ne-tuning the whole network gives\\nonly marginal improvement over training the last layer only. In the latter setting, higher dropout\\nover-regularises learning and leads to worse accuracy.

We conclude the experimental evaluation with the com-\nparison against the state of the art on three splits of UCF-101 and HMDB-51. For that we used a\nspatial net, pre-trained on ILSVRC, with the last layer trained on UCF or HMDB. The temporal\nnet was trained on UCF and HMDB using multi-task learning, and the input was computed using\nuni-directional optical ﬂow stacking with mean subtraction. The softmax scores of the two nets were\ncombined using averaging or SVM. As can be seen from Table 4, both our spatial and temporal nets\nalone outperform the deep architectures of [14, 16] by a large margin. The combination of the two\nnets further improves the results (in line with the single-split experiments above), and is comparable\nto the very recent state-of-the-art hand-crafted models [20, 21, 26].\nTable 4: Mean accuracy (over three splits) on UCF-101 and HMDB-51.\nMethod UCF-101 HMDB-51\nImproved dense trajectories (IDT) [26, 27] 85.9% 57.2%\nIDT with higher-dimensional encodings [20] 87.9% 61.1%\nIDT with stacked Fisher encoding [21] (based on Deep Fisher Net [23]) - 66.8%\nSpatio-temporal HMAX network [11, 16] - 22.8%\n“Slow fusion” spatio-temporal ConvNet [14] 65.4% -\nSpatial stream ConvNet 73.0% 40.5%\nTemporal stream ConvNet 83.7% 54.6%\nTwo-stream model (fusion by averaging) 86.9% 58.0%\nTwo-stream model (fusion by SVM) 88.0% 59.4%\nConfusion matrix and per-class recall for UCF-101 classiﬁcation. In Fig. 5 we show the confu-\nsion matrix for UCF-101 classiﬁcation using our two-stream model, which achieves 87:0%accuracy\non the ﬁrst dataset split (the last row of Table 3). We also visualise the corresponding per-class recall\nin Fig. 6.\n8The worst class recall corresponds to Hammering class, which is confused with HeadMassage and\nBrushingTeeth classes. We found that this is due to two reasons. First, the spatial ConvNet confuses\nHammering with HeadMassage , which can be caused by the signiﬁcant presence of human faces\nin both classes. Second, the temporal ConvNet confuses Hammering with BrushingTeeth , as both\nactions contain recurring motion patterns (hand moving up and down).\nFigure 5: Confusion matrix of a two-stream model on the ﬁrst split of UCF-101.\n7 Conclusions and directions for improvement\nWe proposed a deep video classiﬁcation model with competitive performance, which incorporates\nseparate spatial and temporal recognition streams based on ConvNets. Currently it appears that\ntraining a temporal ConvNet on optical ﬂow (as here) is signiﬁcantly better than training on raw\nstacked frames [14]. The latter is probably too challenging, and might require architectural changes\n(for example, a combination with the deep matching approach of [30]). Despite using optical ﬂow\nas input, our temporal model does not require signiﬁcant hand-crafting, since the ﬂow is computed\nusing a method based on the generic assumptions of constancy and smoothness.\nAs we have shown, extra training data is beneﬁcial for our temporal ConvNet, so we are planning to\ntrain it on large video datasets, such as the recently released collection of [14]. This, however, poses\na signiﬁcant challenge on its own due to the gigantic amount of training data (multiple TBs).\nThere still remain some essential ingredients of the state-of-the-art shallow representation [26],\nwhich are missed in our current architecture. The most prominent one is local feature pooling\nover spatio-temporal tubes, centered at the trajectories. Even though the input (2) captures the opti-\ncal ﬂow along the trajectories, the spatial pooling in our network does not take the trajectories into\naccount. Another potential area of improvement is explicit handling of camera motion, which in our\ncase is compensated by mean displacement subtraction.\n9Figure 6: Per-class recall of a two-stream model on the ﬁrst split of UCF-101.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by ERC grant VisRec no. 228180.

The approach, ﬁrst in-\ntroduced in [29], consists in adjusting local descriptor support regions, so that they follow dense\ntrajectories, computed using optical ﬂow. The best performance in the trajectory-based pipeline\nwas achieved by the Motion Boundary Histogram (MBH) [8], which is a gradient-based feature,\nseparately computed on the horizontal and vertical components of optical ﬂow. A combination of\nseveral features was shown to further boost the accuracy. Recent improvements of trajectory-based\nhand-crafted representations include compensation of global (camera) motion [10, 16, 26], and the\nuse of the Fisher vector encoding [22] (in [26]) or its deeper variant [23] (in [21]).\nThere has also been a number of attempts to develop a deep architecture for video recognition. In\nthe majority of these works, the input to the network is a stack of consecutive video frames, so the\nmodel is expected to implicitly learn spatio-temporal motion-dependent features in the ﬁrst layers,\nwhich can be a difﬁcult task. In [11], an HMAX architecture for video recognition was proposed\nwith pre-deﬁned spatio-temporal ﬁlters in the ﬁrst layer. Later, it was combined [16] with a spatial\nHMAX model, thus forming spatial (ventral-like) and temporal (dorsal-like) recognition streams.\nUnlike our work, however, the streams were implemented as hand-crafted and rather shallow (3-\nlayer) HMAX models. In [4, 18, 25], a convolutional RBM and ISA were used for unsupervised\nlearning of spatio-temporal features, which were then plugged into a discriminative model for action\nclassiﬁcation. Discriminative end-to-end learning of video ConvNets has been addressed in [12]\nand, more recently, in [14], who compared several ConvNet architectures for action recognition.\nTraining was carried out on a very large Sports-1M dataset, comprising 1.1M YouTube videos of\nsports activities. Interestingly, [14] found that a network, operating on individual video frames,\nperforms similarly to the networks, whose input is a stack of frames. This might indicate that\nthe learnt spatio-temporal features do not capture the motion well. The learnt representation, ﬁne-\ntuned on the UCF-101 dataset, turned out to be 20% less accurate than hand-crafted state-of-the-art\ntrajectory-based representation [20, 27].\nOur temporal stream ConvNet operates on multiple-frame dense optical ﬂow, which is typically\ncomputed in an energy minimisation framework by solving for a displacement ﬁeld (typically at\nmultiple image scales). We used a popular method of [2], which formulates the energy based on\nconstancy assumptions for intensity and its gradient, as well as smoothness of the displacement ﬁeld.\nRecently, [30] proposed an image patch matching scheme, which is reminiscent of deep ConvNets,\nbut does not incorporate learning.\n2 Two-stream architecture for video recognition\nVideo can naturally be decomposed into spatial and temporal components. The spatial part, in the\nform of individual frame appearance, carries information about scenes and objects depicted in the\nvideo. The temporal part, in the form of motion across the frames, conveys the movement of the\nobserver (the camera) and the objects. We devise our video recognition architecture accordingly,\ndividing it into two streams, as shown in Fig. 1. Each stream is implemented using a deep ConvNet,\nsoftmax scores of which are combined by late fusion. We consider two fusion methods: averaging\nand training a multi-class linear SVM [6] on stacked L2-normalised softmax scores as features.\n2conv1  \n7x7x96  \nstride 2  \nnorm.  \npool 2x2  conv2  \n5x5x256  \nstride 2  \nnorm.  \npool 2x2  conv3  \n3x3x512  \nstride 1  conv4  \n3x3x512  \nstride 1  conv5  \n3x3x512  \nstride 1  \npool 2x2  full6 \n4096  \ndropout  full7 \n2048  \ndropout  softmax  \n \nconv1  \n7x7x96  \nstride 2  \nnorm.  \npool 2x2  conv2  \n5x5x256  \nstride 2  \npool 2x2  conv3  \n3x3x512  \nstride 1  conv4  \n3x3x512  \nstride 1  conv5  \n3x3x512  \nstride 1  \npool 2x2  full6 \n4096  \ndropout  full7 \n2048  \ndropout  softmax  \n Spatial stream ConvNet  \nTemporal stream ConvNet  \nsingle frame  \ninput  \nvideo  \nmulti -frame  \noptical flow  class \nscore  \nfusion  \nFigure 1: Two-stream architecture for video classiﬁcation.\nSpatial stream ConvNet operates on individual video frames, effectively performing action recog-\nnition from still images. The static appearance by itself is a useful clue, since some actions are\nstrongly associated with particular objects. In fact, as will be shown in Sect. 6, action classiﬁcation\nfrom still frames (the spatial recognition stream) is fairly competitive on its own. Since a spatial\nConvNet is essentially an image classiﬁcation architecture, we can build upon the recent advances\nin large-scale image recognition methods [15], and pre-train the network on a large image classiﬁca-\ntion dataset, such as the ImageNet challenge dataset.

In\\nparticular, we measure the effect of: using multiple ( L=f5;10g) stacked optical \\ufb02ows; trajectory\\nstacking; mean displacement subtraction; using the bi-directional optical \\ufb02ow. The architectures\\nare trained on the UCF-101 dataset from scratch, so we used an aggressive dropout ratio of 0:9to\\nhelp improve generalisation. The results are shown in Table 1b. First, we can conclude that stacking\\nmultiple (L>1) displacement \\ufb01elds in the input is highly bene\\ufb01cial, as it provides the network with\\nlong-term motion information, which is more discriminative than the \\ufb02ow between a pair of frames\\n(L= 1setting). Increasing the number of input \\ufb02ows from 5to10leads to a smaller improvement,\\nso we keptL\\ufb01xed to 10in the following experiments. Second, we \\ufb01nd that mean subtraction is\\nhelpful, as it reduces the effect of global motion between the frames. We use it in the following\\nexperiments as default. The difference between different stacking techniques is marginal; it turns\\nout that optical \\ufb02ow stacking performs better than trajectory stacking, and using the bi-directional\\noptical \\ufb02ow is only slightly better than a uni-directional forward \\ufb02ow. Finally, we note that temporal\\nConvNets signi\\ufb01cantly outperform the spatial ConvNets (Table 1a), which con\\ufb01rms the importance\\nof motion information for action recognition.\\nWe also implemented the \\u201cslow fusion\\u201d architecture of [14], which amounts to applying a ConvNet\\nto a stack of RGB frames ( 11frames in our case). When trained from scratch on UCF-101, it\\nachieved 56:4%accuracy, which is better than a single-frame architecture trained from scratch\\n(52:3%), but is still far off the network trained from scratch on optical \\ufb02ow. This shows that while\\nmulti-frame information is important, it is also important to present it to a ConvNet in an appropriate\\nmanner.\\nMulti-task learning of temporal ConvNets. Training temporal ConvNets on UCF-101 is challeng-\\ning due to the small size of the training set. An even bigger challenge is to train the ConvNet on\\nHMDB-51, where each training split is 2:6times smaller than that of UCF-101. Here we evaluate\\ndifferent options for increasing the effective training set size of HMDB-51: (i) \\ufb01ne-tuning a temporal\\nnetwork pre-trained on UCF-101; (ii) adding 78classes from UCF-101, which are manually selected\\nso that there is no intersection between these classes and the native HMDB-51 classes; (iii) using the\\nmulti-task formulation (Sect. 4) to learn a video representation, shared between the UCF-101 and\\nHMDB-51 classi\\ufb01cation tasks. The results are reported in Table 2. As expected, it is bene\\ufb01cial to\\n7Table 2: Temporal ConvNet accuracy on HMDB-51 (split 1 with additional training data).\\nTraining setting Accuracy\\nTraining on HMDB-51 without additional data 46.6%\\nFine-tuning a ConvNet, pre-trained on UCF-101 49.0%\\nTraining on HMDB-51 with classes added from UCF-101 52.8%\\nMulti-task learning on HMDB-51 and UCF-101 55.4%\\nutilise full (all splits combined) UCF-101 data for training (either explicitly by borrowing images, or\\nimplicitly by pre-training). Multi-task learning performs the best, as it allows the training procedure\\nto exploit all available training data.\\nWe have also experimented with multi-task learning on the UCF-101 dataset, by training a network\\nto classify both the full HMDB-51 data (all splits combined) and the UCF-101 data (a single split).\\nOn the \\ufb01rst split of UCF-101, the accuracy was measured to be 81.5%, which improves on 81:0%\\nachieved using the same settings, but without the additional HMDB classi\\ufb01cation task (Table 1b).\\nTwo-stream ConvNets. Here we evaluate the complete two-stream model, which combines the\\ntwo recognition streams. One way of combining the networks would be to train a joint stack of\\nfully-connected layers on top of full6 or full7 layers of the two nets. This, however, was not feasible\\nin our case due to over-\\ufb01tting. We therefore fused the softmax scores using either averaging or\\na linear SVM. From Table 3 we conclude that: (i) temporal and spatial recognition streams are\\ncomplementary, as their fusion signi\\ufb01cantly improves on both (6%over temporal and 14% over\\nspatial nets); (ii) SVM-based fusion of softmax scores outperforms fusion by averaging; (iii) using\\nbi-directional \\ufb02ow is not bene\\ufb01cial in the case of ConvNet fusion; (iv) temporal ConvNet, trained\\nusing multi-task learning, performs the best both alone and when fused with a spatial net.\\nTable 3: Two-stream ConvNet accuracy on UCF-101 (split 1).\\nSpatial ConvNet Temporal ConvNet Fusion Method Accuracy\\nPre-trained + last layer bi-directional averaging 85.6%\\nPre-trained + last layer uni-directional averaging 85.9%\\nPre-trained + last layer uni-directional, multi-task averaging 86.2%\\nPre-trained + last layer\\n######################\\nOutput:\\n\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"temporal ConvNet\\\"<|>\\\"technology\\\"<|>\\\"Temporal ConvNet is a deep learning model used for action recognition by processing temporal information from video frames.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"spatial ConvNet\\\"<|>\\\"technology\\\"<|>\\\"Spatial ConvNet is another type of deep learning model, which processes spatial information from single frames in videos.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"UCF-101 dataset\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"UCF-101 dataset is a well-known dataset for action recognition and contains 101 different classes of actions.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"HMDB-51 dataset\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"HMDB-51 dataset is another dataset used for recognizing human motion and contains 51 classes of actions, smaller than UCF-101 in terms of training set size.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"ConvNet architectures\\\"<|>\\\"technology\\\"<|>\\\"ConvNet architectures refer to various configurations of Convolutional Neural Networks designed for processing visual data.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"temporal ConvNet\\\"<|>\\\"UCF-101 dataset\\\"<|>\\\"Temporal ConvNets are trained on the UCF-101 dataset, which is a significant source of training data for them.\\\" <|><\\\"training, dataset usage\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"spatial ConvNet\\\"<|>\\\"UCF-101 dataset\\\"<|>\\\"Spatial ConvNets are also trained on the UCF-101 dataset but perform differently from Temporal ConvNets in terms of accuracy.\\\" <|><\\\"training, dataset usage\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"temporal ConvNet\\\"<|>\\\"HMDB-51 dataset\\\"<|>\\\"Temporal ConvNets are evaluated using HMDB-51 dataset, which is smaller but complementary to UCF-101 in terms of action classes.\\\" <|><\\\"evaluation, dataset usage\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"multi-task learning\\\"<|>\\\"technique\\\"<|>\\\"Multi-task learning involves training a single model on multiple related tasks, enhancing its generalization and performance on both datasets.\\\" <|><\\\"training technique, multi-tasking\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"ConvNet architectures, temporal information, UCF-101 dataset, HMDB-51 dataset, multi-task learning\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities were missed in the last extraction.

The challenge is to capture\nthe complementary information on appearance from still frames and motion be-\ntween frames. We also aim to generalise the best performing hand-crafted features\nwithin a data-driven learning framework.\nOur contribution is three-fold. First, we propose a two-stream ConvNet architec-\nture which incorporates spatial and temporal networks. Second, we demonstrate\nthat a ConvNet trained on multi-frame dense optical ﬂow is able to achieve very\ngood performance in spite of limited training data. Finally, we show that multi-\ntask learning, applied to two different action classiﬁcation datasets, can be used to\nincrease the amount of training data and improve the performance on both.\nOur architecture is trained and evaluated on the standard video actions bench-\nmarks of UCF-101 and HMDB-51, where it is competitive with the state of the\nart. It also exceeds by a large margin previous attempts to use deep nets for video\nclassiﬁcation.\n1 Introduction\nRecognition of human actions in videos is a challenging task which has received a signiﬁcant amount\nof attention in the research community [11, 14, 17, 26]. Compared to still image classiﬁcation, the\ntemporal component of videos provides an additional (and important) clue for recognition, as a\nnumber of actions can be reliably recognised based on the motion information. Additionally, video\nprovides natural data augmentation (jittering) for single image (video frame) classiﬁcation.\nIn this work, we aim at extending deep Convolutional Networks (ConvNets) [19], a state-of-the-\nart still image representation [15], to action recognition in video data. This task has recently been\naddressed in [14] by using stacked video frames as input to the network, but the results were signif-\nicantly worse than those of the best hand-crafted shallow representations [20, 26]. We investigate\na different architecture based on two separate recognition streams (spatial and temporal), which\nare then combined by late fusion. The spatial stream performs action recognition from still video\nframes, whilst the temporal stream is trained to recognise action from motion in the form of dense\noptical ﬂow. Both streams are implemented as ConvNets. Decoupling the spatial and temporal nets\nalso allows us to exploit the availability of large amounts of annotated image data by pre-training\nthe spatial net on the ImageNet challenge dataset [1]. Our proposed architecture is related to the\ntwo-streams hypothesis [9], according to which the human visual cortex contains two pathways: the\nventral stream (which performs object recognition) and the dorsal stream (which recognises motion);\nthough we do not investigate this connection any further here.\nThe rest of the paper is organised as follows. In Sect. 1.1 we review the related work on action\nrecognition using both shallow and deep architectures. In Sect. 2 we introduce the two-stream\narchitecture and specify the Spatial ConvNet. Sect. 3 introduces the Temporal ConvNet and in\nparticular how it generalizes the previous architectures reviewed in Sect. 1.1. A mult-task learning\nframework is developed in Sect. 4 in order to allow effortless combination of training data over\n1arXiv:1406.2199v2  [cs.CV]  12 Nov 2014multiple datasets. Implementation details are given in Sect. 5, and the performance is evaluated\nin Sect. 6 and compared to the state of the art. Our experiments on two challenging datasets (UCF-\n101 [24] and HMDB-51 [16]) show that the two recognition streams are complementary, and our\ndeep architecture signiﬁcantly outperforms that of [14] and is competitive with the state of the art\nshallow representations [20, 21, 26] in spite of being trained on relatively small datasets.\n1.1 Related work\nVideo recognition research has been largely driven by the advances in image recognition methods,\nwhich were often adapted and extended to deal with video data. A large family of video action\nrecognition methods is based on shallow high-dimensional encodings of local spatio-temporal fea-\ntures. For instance, the algorithm of [17] consists in detecting sparse spatio-temporal interest points,\nwhich are then described using local spatio-temporal features: Histogram of Oriented Gradients\n(HOG) [7] and Histogram of Optical Flow (HOF). The features are then encoded into the Bag Of\nFeatures (BoF) representation, which is pooled over several spatio-temporal grids (similarly to spa-\ntial pyramid pooling) and combined with an SVM classiﬁer. In a later work [28], it was shown that\ndense sampling of local features outperforms sparse interest points.\nInstead of computing local video features over spatio-temporal cuboids, state-of-the-art shallow\nvideo representations [20, 21, 26] make use of dense point trajectories. The approach, ﬁrst in-\ntroduced in [29], consists in adjusting local descriptor support regions, so that they follow dense\ntrajectories, computed using optical ﬂow. The best performance in the trajectory-based pipeline\nwas achieved by the Motion Boundary Histogram (MBH) [8], which is a gradient-based feature,\nseparately computed on the horizontal and vertical components of optical ﬂow.

We conclude the experimental evaluation with the com-\\nparison against the state of the art on three splits of UCF-101 and HMDB-51. For that we used a\\nspatial net, pre-trained on ILSVRC, with the last layer trained on UCF or HMDB. The temporal\\nnet was trained on UCF and HMDB using multi-task learning, and the input was computed using\\nuni-directional optical \\ufb02ow stacking with mean subtraction. The softmax scores of the two nets were\\ncombined using averaging or SVM. As can be seen from Table 4, both our spatial and temporal nets\\nalone outperform the deep architectures of [14, 16] by a large margin. The combination of the two\\nnets further improves the results (in line with the single-split experiments above), and is comparable\\nto the very recent state-of-the-art hand-crafted models [20, 21, 26].\\nTable 4: Mean accuracy (over three splits) on UCF-101 and HMDB-51.\\nMethod UCF-101 HMDB-51\\nImproved dense trajectories (IDT) [26, 27] 85.9% 57.2%\\nIDT with higher-dimensional encodings [20] 87.9% 61.1%\\nIDT with stacked Fisher encoding [21] (based on Deep Fisher Net [23]) - 66.8%\\nSpatio-temporal HMAX network [11, 16] - 22.8%\\n\\u201cSlow fusion\\u201d spatio-temporal ConvNet [14] 65.4% -\\nSpatial stream ConvNet 73.0% 40.5%\\nTemporal stream ConvNet 83.7% 54.6%\\nTwo-stream model (fusion by averaging) 86.9% 58.0%\\nTwo-stream model (fusion by SVM) 88.0% 59.4%\\nConfusion matrix and per-class recall for UCF-101 classi\\ufb01cation.

We also visualise the corresponding per-class recall\\nin Fig. 6.\\n8The worst class recall corresponds to Hammering class, which is confused with HeadMassage and\\nBrushingTeeth classes. We found that this is due to two reasons. First, the spatial ConvNet confuses\\nHammering with HeadMassage , which can be caused by the signi\\ufb01cant presence of human faces\\nin both classes. Second, the temporal ConvNet confuses Hammering with BrushingTeeth , as both\\nactions contain recurring motion patterns (hand moving up and down).\\nFigure 5: Confusion matrix of a two-stream model on the \\ufb01rst split of UCF-101.\\n7 Conclusions and directions for improvement\\nWe proposed a deep video classi\\ufb01cation model with competitive performance, which incorporates\\nseparate spatial and temporal recognition streams based on ConvNets. Currently it appears that\\ntraining a temporal ConvNet on optical \\ufb02ow (as here) is signi\\ufb01cantly better than training on raw\\nstacked frames [14]. The latter is probably too challenging, and might require architectural changes\\n(for example, a combination with the deep matching approach of [30]). Despite using optical \\ufb02ow\\nas input, our temporal model does not require signi\\ufb01cant hand-crafting, since the \\ufb02ow is computed\\nusing a method based on the generic assumptions of constancy and smoothness.\\nAs we have shown, extra training data is bene\\ufb01cial for our temporal ConvNet, so we are planning to\\ntrain it on large video datasets, such as the recently released collection of [14]. This, however, poses\\na signi\\ufb01cant challenge on its own due to the gigantic amount of training data (multiple TBs).\\nThere still remain some essential ingredients of the state-of-the-art shallow representation [26],\\nwhich are missed in our current architecture. The most prominent one is local feature pooling\\nover spatio-temporal tubes, centered at the trajectories. Even though the input (2) captures the opti-\\ncal \\ufb02ow along the trajectories, the spatial pooling in our network does not take the trajectories into\\naccount. Another potential area of improvement is explicit handling of camera motion, which in our\\ncase is compensated by mean displacement subtraction.\\n9Figure 6: Per-class recall of a two-stream model on the \\ufb01rst split of UCF-101.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThis work was supported by ERC grant VisRec no. 228180.

Other ﬁlters compute temporal derivatives, capturing changes in motion over time.\n4 Multi-task learning\nUnlike the spatial stream ConvNet, which can be pre-trained on a large still image classiﬁcation\ndataset (such as ImageNet), the temporal ConvNet needs to be trained on video data – and the\navailable datasets for video action classiﬁcation are still rather small. In our experiments (Sect. 6),\ntraining is performed on the UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets, which have only: 9.5K and 3.7K\nvideos respectively. To decrease over-ﬁtting, one could consider combining the two datasets into\none; this, however, is not straightforward due to the intersection between the sets of classes. One\noption (which we evaluate later) is to only add the images from the classes, which do not appear in\nthe original dataset. This, however, requires manual search for such classes and limits the amount\nof additional training data.\nA more principled way of combining several datasets is based on multi-task learning [5]. Its aim\nis to learn a (video) representation, which is applicable not only to the task in question (such as\nHMDB-51 classiﬁcation), but also to other tasks (e.g. UCF-101 classiﬁcation). Additional tasks act\nas a regulariser, and allow for the exploitation of additional training data. In our case, a ConvNet\narchitecture is modiﬁed so that it has twosoftmax classiﬁcation layers on top of the last fully-\n5connected layer: one softmax layer computes HMDB-51 classiﬁcation scores, the other one – the\nUCF-101 scores. Each of the layers is equipped with its own loss function, which operates only on\nthe videos, coming from the respective dataset. The overall training loss is computed as the sum of\nthe individual tasks’ losses, and the network weight derivatives can be found by back-propagation.\n5 Implementation details\nConvNets conﬁguration. The layer conﬁguration of our spatial and temporal ConvNets is schemat-\nically shown in Fig. 1. It corresponds to CNN-M-2048 architecture of [3] and is similar to the\nnetwork of [31]. All hidden weight layers use the rectiﬁcation (ReLU) activation function; max-\npooling is performed over 3\u00023spatial windows with stride 2; local response normalisation uses the\nsame settings as [15]. The only difference between spatial and temporal ConvNet conﬁgurations is\nthat we removed the second normalisation layer from the latter to reduce memory consumption.\nTraining. The training procedure can be seen as an adaptation of that of [15] to video frames, and\nis generally the same for both spatial and temporal nets. The network weights are learnt using the\nmini-batch stochastic gradient descent with momentum (set to 0.9). At each iteration, a mini-batch\nof 256 samples is constructed by sampling 256 training videos (uniformly across the classes), from\neach of which a single frame is randomly selected. In spatial net training, a 224\u0002224sub-image is\nrandomly cropped from the selected frame; it then undergoes random horizontal ﬂipping and RGB\njittering. The videos are rescaled beforehand, so that the smallest side of the frame equals 256. We\nnote that unlike [15], the sub-image is sampled from the whole frame, not just its 256\u0002256center.\nIn the temporal net training, we compute an optical ﬂow volume Ifor the selected training frame as\ndescribed in Sect. 3. From that volume, a ﬁxed-size 224\u0002224\u00022Linput is randomly cropped and\nﬂipped. The learning rate is initially set to 10\u00002, and then decreased according to a ﬁxed schedule,\nwhich is kept the same for all training sets. Namely, when training a ConvNet from scratch, the rate\nis changed to 10\u00003after 50K iterations, then to 10\u00004after 70K iterations, and training is stopped\nafter 80K iterations. In the ﬁne-tuning scenario, the rate is changed to 10\u00003after 14K iterations, and\ntraining stopped after 20K iterations.\nTesting. At test time, given a video, we sample a ﬁxed number of frames ( 25in our experiments)\nwith equal temporal spacing between them. From each of the frames we then obtain 10 ConvNet\ninputs [15] by cropping and ﬂipping four corners and the center of the frame. The class scores for the\nwhole video are then obtained by averaging the scores across the sampled frames and crops therein.\nPre-training on ImageNet ILSVRC-2012. When pre-training the spatial ConvNet, we use the\nsame training and test data augmentation as described above (cropping, ﬂipping, RGB jittering).\nThis yields 13:5%top-5 error on ILSVRC-2012 validation set, which compares favourably to 16:0%\nreported in [31] for a similar network. We believe that the main reason for the improvement is\nsampling\n######################\nOutput:\n"

The challenge is to capture\\nthe complementary information on appearance from still frames and motion be-\\ntween frames. We also aim to generalise the best performing hand-crafted features\\nwithin a data-driven learning framework.\\nOur contribution is three-fold. First, we propose a two-stream ConvNet architec-\\nture which incorporates spatial and temporal networks. Second, we demonstrate\\nthat a ConvNet trained on multi-frame dense optical \\ufb02ow is able to achieve very\\ngood performance in spite of limited training data. Finally, we show that multi-\\ntask learning, applied to two different action classi\\ufb01cation datasets, can be used to\\nincrease the amount of training data and improve the performance on both.\\nOur architecture is trained and evaluated on the standard video actions bench-\\nmarks of UCF-101 and HMDB-51, where it is competitive with the state of the\\nart. It also exceeds by a large margin previous attempts to use deep nets for video\\nclassi\\ufb01cation.\\n1 Introduction\\nRecognition of human actions in videos is a challenging task which has received a signi\\ufb01cant amount\\nof attention in the research community [11, 14, 17, 26]. Compared to still image classi\\ufb01cation, the\\ntemporal component of videos provides an additional (and important) clue for recognition, as a\\nnumber of actions can be reliably recognised based on the motion information. Additionally, video\\nprovides natural data augmentation (jittering) for single image (video frame) classi\\ufb01cation.\\nIn this work, we aim at extending deep Convolutional Networks (ConvNets) [19], a state-of-the-\\nart still image representation [15], to action recognition in video data. This task has recently been\\naddressed in [14] by using stacked video frames as input to the network, but the results were signif-\\nicantly worse than those of the best hand-crafted shallow representations [20, 26]. We investigate\\na different architecture based on two separate recognition streams (spatial and temporal), which\\nare then combined by late fusion. The spatial stream performs action recognition from still video\\nframes, whilst the temporal stream is trained to recognise action from motion in the form of dense\\noptical \\ufb02ow. Both streams are implemented as ConvNets. Decoupling the spatial and temporal nets\\nalso allows us to exploit the availability of large amounts of annotated image data by pre-training\\nthe spatial net on the ImageNet challenge dataset [1]. Our proposed architecture is related to the\\ntwo-streams hypothesis [9], according to which the human visual cortex contains two pathways: the\\nventral stream (which performs object recognition) and the dorsal stream (which recognises motion);\\nthough we do not investigate this connection any further here.\\nThe rest of the paper is organised as follows. In Sect. 1.1 we review the related work on action\\nrecognition using both shallow and deep architectures. In Sect. 2 we introduce the two-stream\\narchitecture and specify the Spatial ConvNet. Sect. 3 introduces the Temporal ConvNet and in\\nparticular how it generalizes the previous architectures reviewed in Sect. 1.1. A mult-task learning\\nframework is developed in Sect. 4 in order to allow effortless combination of training data over\\n1arXiv:1406.2199v2  [cs.CV]  12 Nov 2014multiple datasets. Implementation details are given in Sect. 5, and the performance is evaluated\\nin Sect. 6 and compared to the state of the art. Our experiments on two challenging datasets (UCF-\\n101 [24] and HMDB-51 [16]) show that the two recognition streams are complementary, and our\\ndeep architecture signi\\ufb01cantly outperforms that of [14] and is competitive with the state of the art\\nshallow representations [20, 21, 26] in spite of being trained on relatively small datasets.\\n1.1 Related work\\nVideo recognition research has been largely driven by the advances in image recognition methods,\\nwhich were often adapted and extended to deal with video data. A large family of video action\\nrecognition methods is based on shallow high-dimensional encodings of local spatio-temporal fea-\\ntures. For instance, the algorithm of [17] consists in detecting sparse spatio-temporal interest points,\\nwhich are then described using local spatio-temporal features: Histogram of Oriented Gradients\\n(HOG) [7] and Histogram of Optical Flow (HOF). The features are then encoded into the Bag Of\\nFeatures (BoF) representation, which is pooled over several spatio-temporal grids (similarly to spa-\\ntial pyramid pooling) and combined with an SVM classi\\ufb01er. In a later work [28], it was shown that\\ndense sampling of local features outperforms sparse interest points.\\nInstead of computing local video features over spatio-temporal cuboids, state-of-the-art shallow\\nvideo representations [20, 21, 26] make use of dense point trajectories. The approach, \\ufb01rst in-\\ntroduced in [29], consists in adjusting local descriptor support regions, so that they follow dense\\ntrajectories, computed using optical \\ufb02ow. The best performance in the trajectory-based pipeline\\nwas achieved by the Motion Boundary Histogram (MBH) [8], which is a gradient-based feature,\\nseparately computed on the horizontal and vertical components of optical \\ufb02ow.

Since a spatial\nConvNet is essentially an image classiﬁcation architecture, we can build upon the recent advances\nin large-scale image recognition methods [15], and pre-train the network on a large image classiﬁca-\ntion dataset, such as the ImageNet challenge dataset. The details are presented in Sect. 5. Next, we\ndescribe the temporal stream ConvNet, which exploits motion and signiﬁcantly improves accuracy.\n3 Optical ﬂow ConvNets\nIn this section, we describe a ConvNet model, which forms the temporal recognition stream of our\narchitecture (Sect. 2). Unlike the ConvNet models, reviewed in Sect. 1.1, the input to our model is\nformed by stacking optical ﬂow displacement ﬁelds between several consecutive frames. Such input\nexplicitly describes the motion between video frames, which makes the recognition easier, as the\nnetwork does not need to estimate motion implicitly. We consider several variations of the optical\nﬂow-based input, which we describe below.\n(a)\n (b)\n (c)\n (d)\n (e)\nFigure 2: Optical ﬂow. (a),(b): a pair of consecutive video frames with the area around a mov-\ning hand outlined with a cyan rectangle. (c): a close-up of dense optical ﬂow in the outlined area;\n(d): horizontal component dxof the displacement vector ﬁeld (higher intensity corresponds to pos-\nitive values, lower intensity to negative values). (e): vertical component dy. Note how (d) and (e)\nhighlight the moving hand and bow. The input to a ConvNet contains multiple ﬂows (Sect. 3.1).\n3.1 ConvNet input conﬁgurations\nOptical ﬂow stacking. A dense optical ﬂow can be seen as a set of displacement vector ﬁelds dt\nbetween the pairs of consecutive frames tandt+ 1. By dt(u;v)we denote the displacement vector\nat the point (u;v)in framet, which moves the point to the corresponding point in the following\nframet+ 1. The horizontal and vertical components of the vector ﬁeld, dx\ntanddy\nt, can be seen\nas image channels (shown in Fig. 2), well suited to recognition using a convolutional network. To\nrepresent the motion across a sequence of frames, we stack the ﬂow channels dx;y\ntofLconsecutive\nframes to form a total of 2Linput channels. More formally, let wandhbe the width and height\nof a video; a ConvNet input volume I\u001c2Rw\u0002h\u00022Lfor an arbitrary frame \u001cis then constructed as\nfollows:\nI\u001c(u;v;2k\u00001) =dx\n\u001c+k\u00001(u;v); (1)\nI\u001c(u;v;2k) =dy\n\u001c+k\u00001(u;v); u = [1;w];v= [1;h];k= [1;L]:\nFor an arbitrary point (u;v), the channels I\u001c(u;v;c );c= [1; 2L]encode the motion at that point\nover a sequence of Lframes (as illustrated in Fig. 3-left).\n3Trajectory stacking. An alternative motion representation, inspired by the trajectory-based de-\nscriptors [29], replaces the optical ﬂow, sampled at the same locations across several frames, with\nthe ﬂow, sampled along the motion trajectories. In this case, the input volume I\u001c, corresponding to\na frame\u001c, takes the following form:\nI\u001c(u;v;2k\u00001) =dx\n\u001c+k\u00001(pk); (2)\nI\u001c(u;v;2k) =dy\n\u001c+k\u00001(pk); u = [1;w];v= [1;h];k= [1;L]:\nwhere pkis thek-th point along the trajectory, which starts at the location (u;v)in the frame \u001cand\nis deﬁned by the following recurrence relation:\np1= (u;v); pk=pk\u00001+d\u001c+k\u00002(pk\u00001); k> 1:\nCompared to the input volume representation (1), where the channels I\u001c(u;v;c )store the displace-\nment vectors at the locations (u;v), the input volume (2) stores the vectors sampled at the locations\npkalong the trajectory (as illustrated in Fig. 3-right).\ninput volume channels  \n                 at point  \ninput volume channels  \n                 at point  \nFigure 3: ConvNet input derivation from the multi-frame optical ﬂow. Left: optical ﬂow stack-\ning (1) samples the displacement vectors dat the same location in multiple frames. Right: trajectory\nstacking (2) samples the vectors along the trajectory. The frames and the corresponding displace-\nment vectors are shown with the same colour.\nBi-directional optical ﬂow. Optical ﬂow representations (1) and (2) deal with the forward optical\nﬂow, i.e. the displacement ﬁeld dtof the frame tspeciﬁes the location of its pixels in the following\nframet+ 1. It is natural to consider an extension to a bi-directional optical ﬂow, which can be\nobtained by computing an additional set of displacement ﬁelds in the opposite direction. We then\nconstruct an input volume I\u001cby stackingL=2forward ﬂows between frames \u001cand\u001c+L\n######################\nOutput:\n"

Other \\ufb01lters compute temporal derivatives, capturing changes in motion over time.\\n4 Multi-task learning\\nUnlike the spatial stream ConvNet, which can be pre-trained on a large still image classi\\ufb01cation\\ndataset (such as ImageNet), the temporal ConvNet needs to be trained on video data \\u2013 and the\\navailable datasets for video action classi\\ufb01cation are still rather small. In our experiments (Sect. 6),\\ntraining is performed on the UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets, which have only: 9.5K and 3.7K\\nvideos respectively. To decrease over-\\ufb01tting, one could consider combining the two datasets into\\none; this, however, is not straightforward due to the intersection between the sets of classes. One\\noption (which we evaluate later) is to only add the images from the classes, which do not appear in\\nthe original dataset. This, however, requires manual search for such classes and limits the amount\\nof additional training data.\\nA more principled way of combining several datasets is based on multi-task learning [5]. Its aim\\nis to learn a (video) representation, which is applicable not only to the task in question (such as\\nHMDB-51 classi\\ufb01cation), but also to other tasks (e.g. UCF-101 classi\\ufb01cation). Additional tasks act\\nas a regulariser, and allow for the exploitation of additional training data. In our case, a ConvNet\\narchitecture is modi\\ufb01ed so that it has twosoftmax classi\\ufb01cation layers on top of the last fully-\\n5connected layer: one softmax layer computes HMDB-51 classi\\ufb01cation scores, the other one \\u2013 the\\nUCF-101 scores. Each of the layers is equipped with its own loss function, which operates only on\\nthe videos, coming from the respective dataset. The overall training loss is computed as the sum of\\nthe individual tasks\\u2019 losses, and the network weight derivatives can be found by back-propagation.\\n5 Implementation details\\nConvNets con\\ufb01guration. The layer con\\ufb01guration of our spatial and temporal ConvNets is schemat-\\nically shown in Fig. 1. It corresponds to CNN-M-2048 architecture of [3] and is similar to the\\nnetwork of [31]. All hidden weight layers use the recti\\ufb01cation (ReLU) activation function; max-\\npooling is performed over 3\\u00023spatial windows with stride 2; local response normalisation uses the\\nsame settings as [15]. The only difference between spatial and temporal ConvNet con\\ufb01gurations is\\nthat we removed the second normalisation layer from the latter to reduce memory consumption.\\nTraining. The training procedure can be seen as an adaptation of that of [15] to video frames, and\\nis generally the same for both spatial and temporal nets. The network weights are learnt using the\\nmini-batch stochastic gradient descent with momentum (set to 0.9). At each iteration, a mini-batch\\nof 256 samples is constructed by sampling 256 training videos (uniformly across the classes), from\\neach of which a single frame is randomly selected. In spatial net training, a 224\\u0002224sub-image is\\nrandomly cropped from the selected frame; it then undergoes random horizontal \\ufb02ipping and RGB\\njittering. The videos are rescaled beforehand, so that the smallest side of the frame equals 256. We\\nnote that unlike [15], the sub-image is sampled from the whole frame, not just its 256\\u0002256center.\\nIn the temporal net training, we compute an optical \\ufb02ow volume Ifor the selected training frame as\\ndescribed in Sect. 3. From that volume, a \\ufb01xed-size 224\\u0002224\\u00022Linput is randomly cropped and\\n\\ufb02ipped. The learning rate is initially set to 10\\u00002, and then decreased according to a \\ufb01xed schedule,\\nwhich is kept the same for all training sets. Namely, when training a ConvNet from scratch, the rate\\nis changed to 10\\u00003after 50K iterations, then to 10\\u00004after 70K iterations, and training is stopped\\nafter 80K iterations. In the \\ufb01ne-tuning scenario, the rate is changed to 10\\u00003after 14K iterations, and\\ntraining stopped after 20K iterations.\\nTesting. At test time, given a video, we sample a \\ufb01xed number of frames ( 25in our experiments)\\nwith equal temporal spacing between them. From each of the frames we then obtain 10 ConvNet\\ninputs [15] by cropping and \\ufb02ipping four corners and the center of the frame. The class scores for the\\nwhole video are then obtained by averaging the scores across the sampled frames and crops therein.\\nPre-training on ImageNet ILSVRC-2012. When pre-training the spatial ConvNet, we use the\\nsame training and test data augmentation as described above (cropping, \\ufb02ipping, RGB jittering).\\nThis yields 13:5%top-5 error on ILSVRC-2012 validation set, which compares favourably to 16:0%\\nreported in [31] for a similar network.

Since a spatial\\nConvNet is essentially an image classi\\ufb01cation architecture, we can build upon the recent advances\\nin large-scale image recognition methods [15], and pre-train the network on a large image classi\\ufb01ca-\\ntion dataset, such as the ImageNet challenge dataset. The details are presented in Sect. 5. Next, we\\ndescribe the temporal stream ConvNet, which exploits motion and signi\\ufb01cantly improves accuracy.\\n3 Optical \\ufb02ow ConvNets\\nIn this section, we describe a ConvNet model, which forms the temporal recognition stream of our\\narchitecture (Sect. 2). Unlike the ConvNet models, reviewed in Sect. 1.1, the input to our model is\\nformed by stacking optical \\ufb02ow displacement \\ufb01elds between several consecutive frames. Such input\\nexplicitly describes the motion between video frames, which makes the recognition easier, as the\\nnetwork does not need to estimate motion implicitly. We consider several variations of the optical\\n\\ufb02ow-based input, which we describe below.\\n(a)\\n (b)\\n (c)\\n (d)\\n (e)\\nFigure 2: Optical \\ufb02ow. (a),(b): a pair of consecutive video frames with the area around a mov-\\ning hand outlined with a cyan rectangle. (c): a close-up of dense optical \\ufb02ow in the outlined area;\\n(d): horizontal component dxof the displacement vector \\ufb01eld (higher intensity corresponds to pos-\\nitive values, lower intensity to negative values). (e): vertical component dy. Note how (d) and (e)\\nhighlight the moving hand and bow. The input to a ConvNet contains multiple \\ufb02ows (Sect. 3.1).\\n3.1 ConvNet input con\\ufb01gurations\\nOptical \\ufb02ow stacking. A dense optical \\ufb02ow can be seen as a set of displacement vector \\ufb01elds dt\\nbetween the pairs of consecutive frames tandt+ 1. By dt(u;v)we denote the displacement vector\\nat the point (u;v)in framet, which moves the point to the corresponding point in the following\\nframet+ 1. The horizontal and vertical components of the vector \\ufb01eld, dx\\ntanddy\\nt, can be seen\\nas image channels (shown in Fig. 2), well suited to recognition using a convolutional network. To\\nrepresent the motion across a sequence of frames, we stack the \\ufb02ow channels dx;y\\ntofLconsecutive\\nframes to form a total of 2Linput channels. More formally, let wandhbe the width and height\\nof a video; a ConvNet input volume I\\u001c2Rw\\u0002h\\u00022Lfor an arbitrary frame \\u001cis then constructed as\\nfollows:\\nI\\u001c(u;v;2k\\u00001) =dx\\n\\u001c+k\\u00001(u;v); (1)\\nI\\u001c(u;v;2k) =dy\\n\\u001c+k\\u00001(u;v); u = [1;w];v= [1;h];k= [1;L]:\\nFor an arbitrary point (u;v), the channels I\\u001c(u;v;c );c= [1; 2L]encode the motion at that point\\nover a sequence of Lframes (as illustrated in Fig. 3-left).\\n3Trajectory stacking. An alternative motion representation, inspired by the trajectory-based de-\\nscriptors [29], replaces the optical \\ufb02ow, sampled at the same locations across several frames, with\\nthe \\ufb02ow, sampled along the motion trajectories. In this case, the input volume I\\u001c, corresponding to\\na frame\\u001c, takes the following form:\\nI\\u001c(u;v;2k\\u00001) =dx\\n\\u001c+k\\u00001(pk); (2)\\nI\\u001c(u;v;2k) =dy\\n\\u001c+k\\u00001(pk); u = [1;w];v= [1;h];k= [1;L]:\\nwhere pkis thek-th point along the trajectory, which starts at the location (u;v)in the frame \\u001cand\\nis de\\ufb01ned by the following recurrence relation:\\np1= (u;v); pk=pk\\u00001+d\\u001c+k\\u00002(pk\\u00001); k> 1:\\nCompared to the input volume representation (1), where the channels I\\u001c(u;v;c )store the displace-\\nment vectors at the locations (u;v), the input volume (2) stores the vectors sampled at the locations\\npkalong the trajectory (as illustrated in Fig. 3-right).\\ninput volume channels  \\n                 at point  \\ninput volume channels  \\n                 at point  \\nFigure 3: ConvNet input derivation from the multi-frame optical \\ufb02ow.
